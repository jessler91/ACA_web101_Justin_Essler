      <h1>Hi</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Justin Essler and I am a full-stack developer in training. I
        like soccer, hiking, and reading business, finance, and history books.
        My current reading list is here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently employed by Enviromedica, a small manufacturer of health
        and wellness products, managing all aspects of eCommerce business
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not a huge fan of the post grade school education system; thus I
        did not attend a 4yr university after high school. I am driven and
        determined, but I do not have that slip of paper that says whatever it
        says. As a side note, STEM degrees from reputable universities are
        absolutely necessary and beneficial for all who take that path.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took a few years figuring things out, but I ended up using job
        training to learn internet marketing. My long-term career goals are a
        bit hazy but I am confident that my marketing experience, combined with
        website development experience, will put me in a decent place when it
        comes to future employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My thought process in the decision to take this class was more of a
        question to why not, software and computer technology will be a critical
        aspect to every business come 20 years, and every manager of a large
        company will need some development/engineering experience to be
        effective within his/her role within the organization.
